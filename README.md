# insults
a small cli insults generator
put it in your path, type "insultMe", and watch it go!

If that's not enough for you, try "insultMe | say" (on mac) and enjoy!

## todo:
+ format file system so that it's idiomatic and makes sense.
+ split the InsultList shakespearean into a separate file, and make it so that other InsultLists can be used.
